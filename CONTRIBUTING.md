# Contributing at Austeritas

Contributions are always welcome at the Austeritas repository and its GitHub pages. Looking forward to great additions,
we ask you to read the following guidelines for a better experience overall.

## Code of conduct

Every interaction with the Austeritas community / GitHub repository has to follow our guidelines specified in the [Code of conduct](https://github.com/AXOMEstudios/austeritas/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Content that does not match these guidelines will be removed and action is taken to protect the community.

## Quality of code

Ensure your code has a sufficient formatting quality and try to match the formatting of the files as good as possible.
This includes the usage of the correct indentation, spaces between special characters and more.

As well, we strongly recommend to run `pytest` in your command line before commiting. This makes sure your code does actually
work - and for the case it doesn't, it will give you detailed information about possible problems. Otherwise, Austeritas will
automatically check for broken code on push using CI and tell you the code doesn't work when it's already too late.

## Usefulness of newly added features

Of course, every addition increasing Austeritas' quality is welcome in the project. Please keep in mind that features have to
be reasonable and contain a decent usability for the end user. The features you add should be use- and helpful, in the best case
not overly specific for one single, rarely occuring situation and intuitive.
